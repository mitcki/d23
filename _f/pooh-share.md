title: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree
fact: Initially, the Sherman Brothers had trouble finding inspiration in <em>Winnie the Pooh</em>. But when they mentioned this to designer Tony Walton, English-born Walton lit up and shared his fondest childhood memories of Pooh. By the end, the Shermans were sold, and stayed true to the charm of A.A. Milne in their songs.
