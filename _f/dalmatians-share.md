fact: <em>101 Dalmatians</em> debuted a new animation process. Animators typically provided cleaned-up sketches to a team that traced those drawings onto cels with ink. With <em>Dalmations</em>, animators photocopied drawings directly onto cels, cutting production time by one-third, and giving the film its unique look.
