fact: In 1904, Sir James M. Barrie’s stage play <em>Peter Pan</em> premiered in London. Years later the play made its way to Marceline, Missouri, where a young farm boy and his brother emptied their toy banks to buy tickets. “For two hours we lived in Never Land,” Walt said later, “but the most thrilling of all was the vision of Peter flying through the air.”
